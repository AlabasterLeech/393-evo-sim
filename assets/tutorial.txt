Section 1 - Introduction:
Welcome to Cellvolution! We hope you'll have a fun time with what we've created. This section will serve as a broad overview of the program and each remaining section will break down each of Cellvolution's individual menus, of course starting with the main menu.
Cellvolution is a "zero-player" game, meaning you control the initial state but have little-to-no input afterwards. As it is a simulation of simple organisms this means what you have control over is how many organisms there are at the start, how big their world is, how abundant resources are, and what they must do to survive. Then you hit play and its up to those little guys to figure the rest out. Let's hope they can!

Section 2 - The Main Menu:
If you're reading this inside Cellvolution, you've actually probably figured this one out because you had to navigate the main menu to even get here. Congrats! If you're reading this before launching the game, the content in this tutorial can also be found by clicking the third button present in the game's main menu. The rest of the main menu is similarly self explanatory. If you have a save file from a previous simulation that you want to continue exploring, the middle button is what you want. We'll discuss saving and loading a little bit more in Section 4. If you're new to Cellvolution or you're looking to start a brand new simulation, the button you're looking for is that top one: New Simulation. Clicking this button will bring you to a new menu with lots of options and will bring us to.....

Section 3 - New Simulation:
Before starting a simulation, you have the ability to adjust a number of parameters. Several of these are fairly self explanatory and I will not spend too much time on them: the enviornment width and height options control the size of the world the simulation will take place in. The food density option controls what proportion of space in the environment will be filled with food at the start of the simulation. The Initial Number Of Organisms controls, you guessed it, the initial number of randomly generated organisms which will populate the simulation.
A few options are a little more complex: Survival Function and Generation Length. The survival function dictates what an individual needs to do to survive. This could be eating enough, being in a certain place, interacting with others, and so on. If an individual doesn't fulfill the survival function in the time they are given to do it, they will not survive and nor will their genes. The Generation Length dictates the length of a generation, i.e. how many actions an organism is able to take before the survival function is checked. Basically every individual thing an organism can do takes one action.
When you're happy with your initial conditions hit the start button to, well, start. But before you do, you might want to first read section 5.
If you're not happy, you can discard your changes and return to the main menu.

Section 4 - Load Simulation:
The load simulation will open a file dialog that allows you to select a JSON file produced by previously saving the game to load up. Upon succesful load, you'll be put into the simulation immediately. Because the JSON format is widely used, its possible to attempt to load JSON files which are not Cellvolution saves. While you are welcome to try this, it is unlikely anything interesting will happen. If a load fails for any reason, you'll just end up back at the main menu.

Section 5 - The Simulation:
We're finally here, the real meat of the game, the simulation! In this menu, you will see two displays and six buttons. The first display is the environment. You will be able to see resources and organisms on the display as little colored dots and some of them'll probably be moving. The second display is off to the side and gives you some broad data about the current state of the simulation like how many organisms are alive, what generation you're on, and so forth. It's all labeled and pretty self explanatory. As for the buttons, from left to right we have:
Play - Resumes the simulation if it is paused.
Pause - Pauses the simulation
Advance One Step - Pauses the simulation and then advances a single step. Repeated presses allow you to go step by step and really see all of what's happening, if you so desire.
Save - Pauses the simulation and opens a filedialog allowing you to save your game as a JSON file to load later.
Modify Simulation - We'll cover this more in the next section, but this button will pause the simulation and bring you to a different menu if you want to change up some things about your simulation or look at something in more detail.
Exit - Pressing the big red 'X' takes you back to the main menu. Make sure you save before you exit!!!!

Section 6 - Modify Simulation:
Here you can change the survival function for the simulation and also view the genome for an individual organism by typing it's ID number into the text entry. Organism ID numbers range from 0 to one less than the current population. Pressing the Back to Simulation button will take you back to your simulation. Simple as that!

And that's really all there is too it! Get out there, learn, and simulate some organisms. Most importantly, have fun!

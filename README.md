# Cellvolution
A small zero-player evolution simulator. Semester long group project for CSDS 393 at CWRU in Fall '23. The project began with a software requirement specification document followed by a design document, neither of which are on GitHub. Design and implementation stems from what was outlined and decided in those two documents.
